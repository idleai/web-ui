# Packaging and releases

Reusable crates are published as `.crate` assets in this repository's GitHub
Releases. The `cargo-index` branch serves the sparse Cargo index with immutable
archive checksums; [Cargo configuration](../.cargo/config.toml) registers it.

The published packages are `web-ui` and `history-geometry`.

## Dependency selection

Checks and builds need only this repository's source. The canonical
`scripts/lint.sh` and `scripts/check.sh` select the latest compatible internal
Cargo releases at the start. The committed `Cargo.lock` supplies the initial
third-party selection. Internal versions must satisfy the requirements in the
workspace manifests.

The resolver verifies published checksums and writes the selected versions and
Cargo lockfile to ignored `target/released-dependencies.json`. CI jobs, release
verification and packaging reuse that selection. CI retains the record as an
artifact, and releases attach it.
A later build of the same commit can select newer dependencies.

Cargo reads the public indexes directly. For an individual local command, run
this from the repository root:

```sh
python3 scripts/release_dependencies.py run -- cargo build --workspace --locked
```

`--locked` keeps later commands within that build on the resolved selection.
Keep consumer minimum versions accurate when adopting a new API: `^0.1.2`
accepts `0.1.3`; adopting `0.2.0` requires a manifest change.

The [Check latest released dependencies workflow](../.github/workflows/update-releases.yml)
checks every 15 minutes, or on manual request, and starts main CI when inputs
change. PR builds resolve immediately. No dependency-update branch or PR is
created. Retry a failed selection through CI or publish a fix for the next check.
Release preparation incorporates the selected Cargo dependencies in its version
commit, allowing dependency changes to produce new packages.

## Automatic releases

The [Release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) starts after successful
`main` CI:

1. Release-plz calculates versions and changelogs from commit messages and Rust
   API checks, then commits the release metadata to `main`.
2. The full CI workflow checks that version commit.
3. Crate archives and Cargo index entries publish from that verified commit
   using its tested dependency selection.

Release preparation uses a normal push, so a concurrent change to `main` cannot
be overwritten. Declare breaking changes and consumer minimum versions in the
feature PR. Documentation changes with no effect on packaged contents do not
create a new package version.

Use **Re-run failed jobs** on the original Release run to finish a failed
publication with its verified commit, even if `main` has advanced. Dispatch
**Release** on `main` to prepare current changes or resume its version commit.
Retries can finish draft releases; published versions and archives are immutable.

## Unpublished integration

For local Rust work, pass a temporary registry patch with
`cargo --config /absolute/path/local.toml ...`. Keep these overrides out of
committed manifests and lockfiles.

For a full check, use
[memos/scripts/check-integration.py](https://github.com/idleai/memos/blob/v1/scripts/check-integration.py)
with explicit `--producer` and `--consumer` checkout paths. Repeat `--producer`
for paired changes, listing native producers in dependency order. The helper
selects candidate Cargo packages, builds compatible native bundles, runs the
consumer's normal check script and restores dependency files on success or
failure. `--output /path/to/results` retains candidate bundles and dependency
records with their checksums. Temporary registry overrides stay outside the
normal manifests; declared minimum versions must match the APIs being consumed. The manual
[Unpublished package integration workflow](https://github.com/idleai/memos/blob/v1/.github/workflows/integration.yml)
runs the same check for selected branches.

## Registry maintenance

Dependabot version updates are paused. Its custom Cargo registry configuration
still requires the Dependabot secret `PUBLIC_CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` set to the
literal value `anonymous`. This public marker is not an access token; the Cargo
indexes remain anonymously readable.
